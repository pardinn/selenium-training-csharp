# Selenium WebDriver With C#

Project created for studying Selenium WebDriver using Selenium

The content was taken from Udemy's course [Selenium WebDriver w/ C# - Build Your Framework](https://www.udemy.com/selenium-with-c/)

##CSharpLessons
This module contains all content relative to the basics of C# and will build up to more advanced stuff towards the end

##In Progress
I'll keep updating this repository once I progress through the course, so this is still an ongoing project
